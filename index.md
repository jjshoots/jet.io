"I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious", I also tend to procrastinate, be easily distracted, and am very indecisive. Given those attributes in proportionate amounts, I'd say I'll be as human as any other human'll ever be. Currently, I am a student in Taylor's University Malaysia, completing my BSc in Mechanical Engineering. My primary interests include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Autonomous Navigation, Control and Machine Intelligence.

This website is a brief [overview of me]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/about), [my projects]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/projects), and an overview of my [professional work]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/publications). Do note that the intention of a projects listing is less documentation and more blog posting.
