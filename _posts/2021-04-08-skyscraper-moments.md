### So, I'm back...
At this rate I'll only end up making one blog post per year, I guess the main issue is I often don't feel like things warrant being written about even though writing serves as a form of abstract memory. What's actually been happening is I'm currently in the UK, far away from home, pursuing a PhD that I _think_ is what I want to do. The reality is I'm not so sure why I'm doing it in the sense that I'm not sure of what I'm going to do after a PhD - and academia isn't one of them.

I miss home. I miss the food, shopping mall scenes, blistering heat and humid weather. I miss the friends, family, banter about the usual day-to-day life of a Malaysian citizen. I also miss a feeling that I think a lot of Malaysians can resonate to. That feeling of being in a developing country knowing that great things are in order and have the potential to come to fruition, even if everything somehow feels like crap. I call this the skyscraper moment.

I like heights. I like the wind in my hair. I like the silent peace you get the higher up you go. I like the idea that moving horizontally is easy, but moving vertically is something not everyone gets to do, this is especially true the higher up you go. Anyone who's known me for a long enough amount of time knows this. And by this extension, I love skyscrapers. I love getting to the top of them, like the very top. Through fire escapes, dimly lit corridors, and maybe through a few busted doors and past some security guards. Views from the top of these places cannot be captured on camera, and hence the feeling is not easily [shared](https://open.spotify.com/track/2kqMzzgzqyDrQO4WurQiJA?si=fSiTgmCXS-GUWnTndeW-7g).

### But I'll try...
The top of skyscrapers are nice because you can be in the middle of a bustling city with commotion around you, but while up there, everything fades away and you see a much wider horizon than what you can see on the ground. It puts my own problems in perspective. There are many possible thoughts when taking in the view:

> I wonder how many people down there have problems larger than mine?

> I wonder how many people have seen what I'm looking at?

> How many man hours are being spent just for the sake of 'getting by'?

> What are the odds of someone down there actually saying life's going good?

From a data driven perspective, being up high is so far from the common realm of what we experience that it can't help but force our minds to think. And given that there is no immediate urgency, the thoughts that we develop are those from the deepest parts of our souls, the ones that bubble up with close friends on a quiet park in the night. Except instead of talking internally about problems of the past, skyscraper moments prompt thoughts about the future, philosophy, life, and what could be.

To me, skyscraper moments are not confined to skyscrapers. They can arise when a person experiences something near euphoric yet humbling (not substance based). Being atop a mountain. Seeing your country's national athlete compete. That dinner with friends after a final exam. And I think to most people, boarding an airplane while going on vacation. I just term them skyscraper moments because being atop one has never not given me that same feeling. Skyscraper moments make you believe you can do anything, they make you believe that there is still potential out there to be seized, they reassure you that no, you have far and away not reached your peak.

Skyscraper moments are hopeful.

### The world is so much bigger than we think it is
I know I'll probably never be able to fathom how much of the world is out there for me to learn about and interact with, and I'm definitely never able to live through every lifestyle and experience I can whimsically make up in my mind. But even if we can't doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Just because an athlete is number 3 in the world and pushing the age of 30 doesn't mean he stops competing because he has no hope of being number 1. He competes because he's human, and human desire is driven by hope. Being hopeful sparks the passion of being able to push through insurmountable, even impossible, odds.

And I guess that's why I'm doing a PhD. I want to find the limit of where I'm able to intellectually and willfully push myself. And although I don't believe in the notion of plateauing, I do believe in the notion of not being able to learn fast enough. That being said, I have no idea if what I attain at the end of this journey will be of any significant milestone towards a planetary contribution I so wish to provide. But what keeps me going I suppose is hope. Just hope that I work hard enough that one day luck will strike and I'll reach somewhere within the realm of where I want to land.

But I gotta say, I miss skyscrapers. And I haven't been atop one in 7 months.

I miss skyscraper moments.

I miss being hopeful without needing to pep talk myself.

And while skyscraper moments are genuine, pep talks can be deceptive.
