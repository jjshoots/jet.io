### Prologue
The year is 2020, the month is January. Coronavirus (ever heard of it?) was in its budding stage of a world stopping pandemic, within 3 months, it would make waves across the globe. It stoped almost all forms of travel, kept people cooped up in homes, displayed to the world that humans aren't as smart as we make ourselves to be, made Dalgona coffee famous, and TikTok an international commodity. Within 6 months, people were accepting wearing masks everywhere as a new norm, and social distancing was the inevitable standard of living, TikTok was still an international commodity, at risk of being sold to the Americans because of an orange-headed blur-case of a man.

And then there was me, a fresh graduate, in the budding stage of his career. Unlike the coronavirus, I had no capacity to influence the world in that manner, and I didn't understand TikTok. I was, like everyone else, a victim of the indirect effects of the virus. But I also was a victim of one more thing; I was unemployed, jobless, and missing a heading.

### The Downfall - The Gradual Chipping Away of My Dreams
If you didn't already know me when reading this, you'll have to know that research into new cutting edge fields of robotics and aviation has been one of my long term goals. Now, fresh out of university, it felt like I could finally start making meaningful steps towards starting this goal. This was, as many research students will tell you, a bad idea. It is usually wiser to start making moves towards a postgraduate programme before you even finish your undergraduate programme, because postgraduate programmes can take a lot of time.

After bumbling around my house enjoying my newfound freedom for the better part of 2 weeks, I started making moves towards some PhD applications. This was met with a lot of application paywalls, test requirements, research proposal submissions, and a lot of jargon that made the whole process very intimidating. Furthermore, the field in which I wanted to specialize in wasn't very large, which made it even harder to find places where I could find a position. This ultimately led to me applying to positions I could apply to for free (paying for tens of applications at several hundred ringgit each didn't make sense at the time), as well as emailing any and all possible postgraduate supervisors. Unfortunately, three months of this on an almost daily basis proved to be very unfruitful, with nay a reply or response from any university or professors (did I mention a pandemic?).

It was at this point where I started making presumptions that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't God-willed to pursue what I've wanted to pursue for so long. Y'know, not everyone gets to do what they want to do right? People eventually plateau out in life, and that's OK. It took time to get off my high chair feeling of being able to conquer anything, and it was also crushing. It's pretty fair to say that at this point in time, I gave up. Tucking my tail between my legs, I started looking for jobs, perhaps I could pursue a PhD some other time in the future, perhaps I'll like my job so much I'll be satisfied where I am.

Anyone who's my age and who has graduated in the same timespan will tell you that finding for a job in the midst of a global pandemic is *hard*. Similarly to how I applied to PhD positions, I applied to well over 40 jobs within Malaysia as well as Singapore, with many of them sending me automated emails notifying me that I am not what they are looking for. This ultimately ended up putting my self esteem even lower in the dumps. And then I did the thing that most of us are usually afraid to do: I started asking seniors and friends if their companies were looking for software/simulation/design engineers.

### A Career Starts Taking Shape, Sort Of
If I have a list of people to thank for getting through the first half of 2020, it would be Joel, a high school friend. Through him, I landed a job at Swisslog Malaysia, who's a member company of the KUKA group. I won't bore you with what exactly it is they do, as that answer is just a Google search away. But essentially what they were looking for was a Design Engineer.

The job interview I had was a very interesting one. It started with a face-to-face interview with Michael, who's the head of the Design Team. Somewhere in the one hour interview, the 3D & Animation Team head - Liew, showed up. And then eventually, Alex, who's in Malaysia temporarily from Germany ended up in the room. The cause all this commotion was because for some reason, even though I applied as a Design Engineer, these people saw the potential in me to be a Simulation Engineer. That would've been fine for most other companies, and things would have gone along swimmingly. The only caveat with Swisslog was that at that time, it *did not* have a Simulation Team yet. It's all a bit intriguing to be but for some odd reason, these three men (who've been at the company for a combined total of more than 25 years), saw a fresh graduate having enough potential to govern putting in the resources and effort into starting a new team, within the company itself.

I'll digress from the actual interview itself, but I have to give special thanks to Alex. During the interview, he personally showed to me the expected job scope and description through actual viewing of what he does on a day-to-day basis - which consisted of a lot of code, coffee, and banging your head against the table. As someone who loves software engineering, this seemed like a wonderful job scope. And thus the story of how I got my first full time job.

### The Job Itself
The job itself wasn't hard; it was frustrating. Nay, it was actually *infuriating*, but only at first. Given that I was thrust into a brand new team, there was actually no training framework in place, and there was a lot of self-learning to do. This is all fine and dandy until you realize that the software framework I was using, Demo3D/Emulate3D, had an almost zero-to-non level of documentation, and no active user base (think of learning how to build a 3000-piece Lego model without the manual). That, plus the fact that in my team, I was the one with the most programming background, meant that I mostly only had myself to rely on when encountered with situations where things were more like:
