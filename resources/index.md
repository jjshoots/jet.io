Here is a list of things which I find useful and intend to find useful in the future. A lot of these are video links as I somehow learn faster from them. Included at the bottom is also a list of books which I like, followed by a list of people I find interesting and tend to look up to. I am by no means an expert in any of these fields, so if you have any suggestions, let me know!
