#### Hi Internet!

My name is Jet, but for those on the formal side: Tai Jun Jet.

I reside in a small country known as Malaysia, and I am a couple months away from the completion of my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am currently a research assistant for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Lab at Taylor's University under [Dr. Phang](http://phangsweeking.com/).


My first introduction to control and electronics came with the classic challenge of designing an inverted pendulum. Since then, I have dabbled in countless electronics and mechanical engineering projects, from automated aircraft painters to scratch build quadrotor vehicles based off the Arduino framework (including sketchy self-developed firmware and single channel RF controller).


Right now I'm developing a robust yet lightweight obstacle avoidance and navigational algorithm for drones that allows high flight speeds with guaranteed convergence to the target. This project is essentially my final year thesis.


Outside of my professional work, I enjoy fishkeeping, music, and photography. Though I'm far from being a professional in any of those fields, I also enjoy the calmness of driving down a freeway in the middle of the night. Feel free to send me electronic mail or DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.author.instagram }})!

Best Regards,

Jet
